# Obesity-Level-Prediction
## Overview

This project applies four machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and KNN) to classify individuals into obesity categories based on demographic and lifestyle features.

## Dataset

Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository â€“ Obesity Dataset]

Variables include age, gender, weight, height, physical activity, eating habits, and other health-related factors.

## Models Implemented

Multinomial Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Results

Random Forest: Best accuracy (93.8%)

KNN (k=3): Strong performance (~83%)

Logistic Regression: Moderate performance but interpretable

Decision Tree: Lower accuracy but useful for variable importance

## Conclusion

Random Forest is recommended for predictive performance, while Logistic Regression is suitable for explainability
